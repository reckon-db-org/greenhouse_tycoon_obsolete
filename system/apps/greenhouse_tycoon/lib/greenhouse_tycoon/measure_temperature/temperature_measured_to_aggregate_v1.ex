  Aggregate event handler for TemperatureMeasured events.
  
  This handler mutates the Greenhouse aggregate state when temperature measurements are recorded.
  Following the vertical slicing architecture, this handler lives in the same slice

  Naming follows the refined pattern: {event}_to_aggregate_v{version}
  - Event: TemperatureMeasured -> temperature_measured
  - Aggregate: Always named 'aggregate' -> aggregate
